karyon
======

Karyon, is the nucleus of all applications inside Netflix. All "micro-services" are created using karyon which provides
a uniform architecture across the organization.
Inside Netflix we have a much powerful version of karyon which has the following key features:

* Integration with netflix infratstructure.
* Capability to pass application/infrastructure context across service calls.
* Capability to intercept changes to service response.
* Capability to publish events via our internal eventbus.
* A rich console to view/edit various facets of netflix environement.

We will be adding all the above functionalities to karyon in the coming months, so stay tuned!
